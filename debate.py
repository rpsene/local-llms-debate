Enhanced Multi-Agent Debate System via Ollama

This script orchestrates a structured debate between multiple AI agents
powered by Ollama. It implements the following features:

1.  Agent Personas: Loaded from a YAML config file for easy customization.
2.  Argument Evolution Tracking: Notes when an agent's position changes.
3.  Moderator Agent: Summarizes rounds and declares a winner.
4.  Semantic Agreement Detection: Ends the debate if agents reach a consensus.
5.  Transcript Export: Saves the full debate to a Markdown file.
6.  Round Timer & Interruptions: Enforces a time limit per round.
7.  Variable Agent Temperament: Controlled via the 'temperature' setting in config.
8.  Voting Mechanism: Agents vote on the most persuasive participant.
